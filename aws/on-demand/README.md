# On-demand AWS S3 bucket scanner

This example provides a stand-alone solution for scanning an AWS S3 bucket using CrowdStrike's QuickScan Pro API. The solution processes existing files within the bucket using configurable batch sizes and concurrent processing for improved performance.

> This example requires the `boto3` and `crowdstrike-falconpy` (v1.3.0+) packages.

## Implementation Details

- Utilizes batch processing and concurrent threading for efficient file scanning
- Files are processed in configurable batch sizes
- Each batch is processed using a configurable number of worker threads
- Memory-efficient streaming of files directly from S3
- Automatic artifact cleanup after processing
- Rotating log file implementation

### Processing Workflow

- Batch Processing:
  - Total files are divided into batches (default: 1000 files per batch)
  - Each batch is processed sequentially

- Worker Threads:
  - Within each batch, files are processed concurrently
  - Number of concurrent operations controlled by max_workers (default: 10)

### Performance Considerations

Performance is influenced by:

- Network bandwidth and latency
- API rate limits
- Number of worker threads
- Batch size configuration

File sizes and quantity

- Recommended deployment in AWS (container, EC2 Instance, or Lambda)
- Files > 256MB are automatically skipped

## Requirements

In order to run this example solution, you will need:

- Name of the target AWS S3 bucket
- The AWS Region associated with the target bucket
- Access to CrowdStrike API keys with the following scopes:

| Service Collection | Scope               |
| :----------------- | :------------------ |
| QuickScan Pro      | __READ__, __WRITE__ |

### Installation

```shell
python3 -m pip install boto3 crowdstrike-falconpy
```

### Execution syntax

The following command will execute the solution against the bucket you specify using default options.

```shell
python3 quickscan_target.py -k CROWDSTRIKE_API_KEY -s CROWDSTRIKE_API_SECRET -t s3://TARGET_BUCKET_NAME -r AWS_REGION
```

A small command-line syntax help utility is available using the `-h` flag.

```shell
âˆš on-demand % piprun quickscan_target.py -h
usage: Falcon Quick Scan [-h] [-l LOG_LEVEL] [-d CHECK_DELAY] [-b BATCH] -r REGION -t TARGET -k KEY -s SECRET

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOG_LEVEL, --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Default log level (DEBUG, WARN, INFO, ERROR)
  -d CHECK_DELAY, --check-delay CHECK_DELAY
                        Delay between checks for scan results
  -b BATCH, --batch BATCH
                        The number of files to include in a volume to scan (default: 1000).
  -w MAX_WORKERS, --workers MAX_WORKERS
                        Maximum number of worker threads to use for scanning (default: 10).
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        Region the target bucket resides in
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Target folder or bucket to scan. Bucket must have 's3://' prefix.
  -k KEY, --key KEY     CrowdStrike Falcon API KEY
  -s SECRET, --secret SECRET
                        CrowdStrike Falcon API SECRET
```

### Usage Example

Basic usage with default settings and batch size set to 3:

```shell
python3 quickscan_target.py -k MYAPIKEY -s MYAPISECRET -r us-east-1 -t s3://my-bucket -b 3
```
